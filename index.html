                <h3>Alu Vaji</h3>
                <p>Boil and peel potatoes. Mash them until lump-free, along with the salt and 3 g of the mustard oil.
                    Slice the onions, garlic, and green chillies

                <h3>Dim vaji</h3>
                <p>Bring a pot of water to a boil. Lower the eggs in the water and cook them on low heat for 6 minutes
                    or 5 minutes, with the lid on. Turn off the heat and let the eggs sit in the hot water for another 3
                    minutes.

                <h3>Khichuri</h3>
                <p>Bring water to the boil in a saucepan. Add the borboti (yard-long bean) and boil covered for 2
                    minutes. They will turn bright green. Take them out of the water and set aside. Blanching the
                    borboti allows us to add it later in the cooking so that the they stay juicy. Frying them in
                    directly in oil makes them shriveled up and dry.
